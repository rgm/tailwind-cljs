# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2020-12-14

The only feature is expanding the project to support server-side Hiccup, and
thus renaming the project from *tailwind-cljs* to *tailwind-hiccup*.

### Changed

- Library now supports use in Clojure, not just Clojurescript
- Core namespace is now `tailwind-hiccup.core`, not `tw-cljs.core`
- Maven coordinates are now `[rgm/tailwind-hiccup "0.2.0"]`, not `-cljs`
